		My favorite place is PFranco. If you like good wine and good meals, I recommend you go to PFranco. Sometimes they serve brains and sometimes they serve pickles. They always serve wine. It is a winer bar.

		I like to go to the beach sometimes. If it is sunny it's great. If it is not it is also cool.
